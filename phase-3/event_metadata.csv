processingPurposeComment,Combining clinical with environmental data to understand better the extrinsic factors that influence health outcomes in rare disease research. The data sources are consulted and combined using federated SPARQL queries by reasoning over location and time. Environmental observations are aggregated within the region of the health event and filtered for a specific period prior to the health event. The resulting dataset contains environmental observations associated to a set of health events related to individuals with a rare disease

identificationRiskComment,"The dataset is considered pseudonymised since effective anonymisation was not possible without losing value of the data for research. Identification risks: (1) singling out of individual subjects, (2) linking of records or matching of data between data sets, and (3) inference of any information about individuals from the data set. (1) Individual patient dates are used to associate environmental data; which in a hospital context the hospital, the individuals could be identified due to the rare disease condition of the patients. (2) Individual patient dates could be linked to hospital attendance registries in the area, public registries, social media data and other sources. (3) The rare condition of the patients, the pseudonymised category of the data together with the location and time expressed in the environmental data could potentially lead to inferring a link even though the information is not expressly linked."
