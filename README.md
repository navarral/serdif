The Semantic Environmental and Rare disease Data Integration Framework (SERDIF) seeks to enable the data linkage between health events and environmental data for health data researchers. 

SERDIF is combination of methods and tools based on the use of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards to model graph data: the Resource Description Framework ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/)), the RDF query language SPARQL [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) and the databases to store RDF graphs.

1. The Knowledge Graph (KG) component is where environmental data and health data is linked together through location and time using [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) and [SPARQL queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/). 
2. The Methodology is a series of steps that guides the researcher in linking particular events with environmental data using Semantic Web technologies.
3. The User Interface (UI) component is designed from a user-centric perspective to support health data researchers access, explore and export the linked health-environmental data with appropriate visualisations, and by facilitating the query formulation for non-Semantic Web experts.

The data linkage takes place at a query level where the geographic location ([GeoSPARQL](https://www.ogc.org/standards/geosparql)) and time window ([xsd:dateTime](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/) are used as the common aspects to link the data for each event.

## Evaluation

The usefulness of the SERDIF framework and the refinement of the initial health data researchers requirements were evaluated through usability testing.
The usability testing approach consisted of three phases: (P1) identifying and refining the initial user requirements, (P2) validation of the usefulness of the framework for HDRs and (P3) consolidation of the requirements. Each phase represented an iteration that comprised the development or refinement of the framework based on the user requirements and the evaluation that provided the basis for the refinement of the framework and requirements.

The SERDIF components evaluated at each of the phases are made available below.
